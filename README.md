# eastings and northings program
A bit of code to grab the eastings and northings of a postcode and save them in an Excel spreadsheet. Uses the Doogal.co.uk website, inputs the postcodes one at a time and scrapes the eastings and northings.

Currently only works on my Mac.

60% of the time, it works every time.

I also have to have a geckodriver thing saved to the same directory as the program.

I don't even know what that is, I just know it needs it to work. 

More work needed.
