#                     Eastings and Northings grabber                     #
#      Requires a list of postcodes in the first column starting in      #
#      cell 2. Postcodes need to be formatted properly. Sheet needs      #
#      two further columns; the first titled 'Eastings' and the second   #
#      titled 'Northings'. Program will find the Eastings and Northings  #
#      of the given postcodes and print them in the adjacent empty       #
#                                   cells.                               #
